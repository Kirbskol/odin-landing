# odin-landing

This repo relates to the second assignment of The Odin Project, within the CSS Foundations section.

This project is to create a landing page from zero, to functional, using only HTML and CSS.

I have based this project on a sim league of which I am an admin and founding member. The Simulation Football Association (SFA/SimFBA) is an online simulation football league site, which has college football/NFL, as well as college basketball/NBA, where you assume the role of a coach, GM, or owner, depending on whether it's pro or college!

The site is run on a custom-built simulation platform that takes inputs from a team's depth chart and game plan. All of this is highly customizable by the user. Users can also recruit players as well - something I know a lot of users of sports simulations absolutely love to do. We always see lots of cool custom pieces of media like news articles, press releases, mini-camps, and even custom social media posts. The core of our community has known each other for a number of years, but we are always welcoming new members.
